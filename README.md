# Hi, I’m Odunze-Akasiugwu Onyinye Shirley

**Data Analyst | Excel • Power BI**   
**AI & Machine Learning Enthusiast (Python)**  

I am a data analyst trained in **Excel spreadsheets and Power BI**, with a strong interest in transforming raw data into meaningful insights that support decision-making.  
More recently, I have expanded my skill set into **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, where I build predictive models and data-driven solutions using Python.

## What I Do
- Analyze and clean data for business and research insights  
- Build interactive dashboards using **Power BI**  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with **Python**  
- Develop basic **machine learning models** for classification and prediction  

## Tools & Technologies
**Data Analysis & Visualization**
- Microsoft Excel (Advanced formulas, PivotTables)
- Power BI (DAX, dashboards, data modeling)

**Programming & Data Science**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

**Other**
- Git & GitHub
- SQL (basic querying)

## Featured Projects
 **Excel & Power BI Projects**
- Sales performance analysis dashboards  
- HR and business intelligence reports  

 **Machine Learning Projects**
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Predictive analytics using real-world datasets
